# WordPress Syntax highlighter

## This is a very simple implementation of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

## Usage

1) Install the plugin into your WordPress plugin directory.
2) Activate plugin.
3) Wrap the code you would like to highlight in <pre><code></code></pre>
4) Enjoy!

## Will add more functionality at a later date.
